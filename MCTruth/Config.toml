# Config File formatted as follows:

# Each parameter is formatted like: [XXX.YYY] where XXX refers to the group of the parameter and YYY refers to the name of the parameter
# Each parameter has exactly two key:value pairs.
#   The first is the actual value of the parameter (a path, a number, a string etc.)
#   The second is the sanity check/constraint on the parameter. See TomlSanityCheck.py for a current list of supported constraints

# This is essentially a poor-mans version of the cue programming language (see https://cuelang.org/docs/usecases/validation/).
# It works for the simple parsing that I am doing though. Also, toml is build into to Python as of 3.11 (I think), so I'm going with this.
